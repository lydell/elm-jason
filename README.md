This is a re-implementation of [elm/json](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/) in Elm (rather than JavaScript).

I did this to learn more deeply how JSON decoding and encoding really works. I’ve tried to comment the code to teach about it – check it out!

I have some loose plans to maybe use the techniques in this package to create an alternate JSON decoding package that explores a slightly different API and different error messages.
