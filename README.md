This started as a re-implementation of [elm/json](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/) in Elm (rather than JavaScript).

I did this to learn more deeply how JSON decoding and encoding really works. It has now turned into an experiment on an alternate JSON decoding and encoding API with different error messages.

(The `tests/` folder has not been updated for the new API yet.)
